##Fault notification application
     
- How it works? For example it could happen that we see broken electrical links which were not fixed for several days. Perhaps company responsible for it even don't knews nothing about this accident. We could make some photos of that links and post it in our app having typed some text, and marked it on the map.

- All posts about breakdowns will be shown on the map and people could observe the problem sloving from their devices.

- Also such methode of informating will help to identify damage after some hurricanes or storms (broken trees, bus stops etc) and also it will give understanding of how huge the problem is.

- When the problem is solved, it will disappear from the map

- Exept it, in future it will be possible to add some notifications for companies or govermental departments which are responsable for some city areas like transportation, electricity or roadside and when people will post about some crashes or brokens - companies themselves will get notification about such problems on email.
