## Inspiration
We want to make city better and more comfortable for all it's owners. 

## What it does
It can happen that we encounter broken electrical connections or other breakdowns that go unfixed for several days. Perhaps the company responsible for them doesnâ€™t even know about these incidents.
Thanks to the CityDesk app, we can bring these issues to public attention and expedite their resolution by simply taking a photo, posting it in our app, and marking it on the map.

All posts about breakdowns will be displayed on the map, allowing people to monitor the problem-solving process from their devices.

Additionally, this method of reporting will help identify damage after hurricanes or storms (such as broken trees and bus stops) and provide insight into the scale of the problem.

Furthermore, in the future, it will be possible to add notifications for companies or government departments responsible for various city services, such as transportation, electricity, or roadside maintenance. When people report accidents or breakdowns, these organizations will receive notifications about such issues via email.
